# sql-demo
This is JavaScript based (Node.js) doctor finder API. Search doctor in any nearby area with many filtaring option like area, doctor specialty and many more.
I am using several technologies in this project. Using Express.js Framework based on Node.js. Also, I am using JWT package for token-based user authentication and authorization system. I am using relational database system commonly known as SQL. Because it is cost effective technology and easy to implementation. But I am using Sequelize. Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. 
This project helps to understand how implementation Sequelize ORM and build project structure like Laravel Framework (PHP Based Framework). Because I am Laravel developer also. Thatâ€™s why I am focusing on it. I think It is help to new developer who want to learn Node.js, who already know Laravel framework.
